# Java_Card_Game

Made when I was in grade 11.

Purpose was to manipulate lists to simulate a card game.
In this case I decided to make my own card game.

At the time I did not decide to have my methods be in seperate files so that could be an improvement that I could make if I decide to make another card game.
